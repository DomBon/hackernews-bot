#node-hn-bot

This is a bot that grabs a random story from [The Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and posts it to [Slack](https://slack.com) (or another service of your choice).

You can schedule this script to run at a regular interval, or have it triggred by an interesting event.

Configuration is straightforward, simply edit CONFIG to taste. After that, you can get your HN fix however you like!
